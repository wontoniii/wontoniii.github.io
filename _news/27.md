Our work on developing VideoJam, a video analytics architecture capable of handling a mix of fixed and mobile cameras has been accepted and will appear at ACM/IEEE SEC 2024. Congrats to my PhD student [Youssouph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssouph-faye/?originalSubdomain=fr) for leading this work!
