We tackle the challenge of executing diverse machine learning pipelines on
heterogeneous computing resources at the network edge. A compelling example of
this challenge is live video analytics, which has emerged as a key network
application of the future, driven by advances in neural network-based video
processing and the rise of edge computing. Existing solutions, however,
predominantly target fixed cameras, whose video streams follow a predictable
path through a hierarchical network of clusters to execute vision pipelines.
With the growing accessibility and widespread adoption of mobile cameras and
devices, it is increasingly essential to incorporate these dynamic video feeds
into analytics architectures. Our work focuses on integrating mobile devices
into analytics platforms by developing innovative system solutions that address
the unique and dynamic nature of these devices.

## VideoJam: Self-Balancing Architecture for Live Video Analytics

*Abstract.* Edge-based live video analytics are a promising
approach to reduce bandwidth overheads caused by the trans-
mission of raw video streams to the cloud. However, the limited
resources available on edge devices make it challenging to
successfully process video streams in real-time. This gets further
exacerbated when attempting to process video streams from
mobile cameras. While mobile cameras are a desirable source
of information, thanks to them being in the right place at the
right time, they are inherently dynamic and unpredictable. To
address these challenges, we propose VideoJam, a decentralized
load balancing solution for live video analytics. VideoJam
uses a set of load balancers to balance incoming video traffic
across replicas without the need of centralized coordination.
Exploiting the inherent load dynamicity generated by different
video sources, VideoJam predicts the incoming load for each
processing component and offloads excessive traffic to less-
loaded neighbors. Further, VideoJam operates independently
of deployed configurations and cameras present in the system,
dynamically adapting to handle load changes and balance video
traffic across available resources. Our evaluation shows that
VideoJam can adapt to different mixes of mobile and fixed
cameras, as well as quickly adapting to configuration changes
occurring at runtime. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions,
VideoJam achieves 2.91x lower response time, while reducing
video data loss by more than 4.64x and generating lower
bandwidth overheads.

## OVIDA: Orchestrator for Video Analytics on Disaggregated Architecture

*Abstract.* Millions of video cameras are deployed globally
across major cities for learning-based video analytic (VA) appli-
cations, such as object detection. Video streams from the cameras
are either sent over the wide-area network to be processed by
the cloud or are (at least partially) processed in a local edge
workstation, incurring significant latency and elevated financial
costs. In this paper, to minimize reliance on the cloud and
overcome the unavailability of high-compute workstations on
edge, we investigate the use of heterogeneous and distributed
embedded devices as edge nodes shared by multiple cameras
to fully serve the video processing needs of a VA application
(without requiring cloud support).
We present OVIDA, an edge-only orchestrator to deploy VA
application(s) on a distributed edge environment to maximize
accuracy. Given the resource-constrained nature of edge nodes,
OVIDA disaggregates the VA application pipeline into multiple
modules. OVIDA’s core functionality and contributions are: (i)
optimizing the placement and replication of the VA application
modules across the edge nodes to maximize the throughput, and
in turn, accuracy; and (ii) an adaptive model selection algorithm
for VA modules based on accuracy-throughput trade-off to
maximize accuracy in response to varying load conditions. To
further improve performance, OVIDA employs a central-queue–
based design (instead of the usual push-based design), which
also obviates the need for complex load balancing algorithms.
We implement OVIDA on top of Kubernetes and evaluate
its performance for three VA applications, supported over a
heterogeneous edge cluster under varying network conditions.
When compared against several baselines in our evaluation, we
achieve throughput and accuracy gains of at least 51% and 28%.

## Optimal Flow Admission Control in Edge Computing via Safe Reinforcement Learning

*Abstract.* With the uptake of intelligent data-driven applications, edge computing infrastructures necessitate a new generation
of admission control algorithms to maximize system performance
under limited and highly heterogeneous resources. In this paper,
we study how to optimally select information flows which belong to
different classes and dispatch them to multiple edge servers where
applications perform flow analytic tasks. The optimal policy is
obtained via the theory of constrained Markov decision processes
(CMDP) to take into account the demand of each edge application
for specific classes of flows, the constraints on computing capacity
of edge servers and the constraints on access network capacity.
We develop DRCPO, a specialized primal-dual Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method which solves the resulting optimal
admission control problem by reward decomposition. DRCPO
operates optimal decentralized control and mitigates effectively
state-space explosion while preserving optimality. Compared to
existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions, extensive
results show that it achieves 15% higher reward on a wide variety
of environments, while requiring on average only 50% learning
episodes to converge. Finally, we further improve the system
performance by matching DRCPO with load-balancing in order to
dispatch optimally information flows to the available edge servers.
