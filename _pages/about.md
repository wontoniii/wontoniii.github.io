I am an Associate Professor (Maître de Conférences) in computer science at [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://ens-lyon.fr)  and I am a member of [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/). 

My research focuses broadly on leveraging emergent technologies to engineer software systems designed to measure and improve network
service performance.

Before joining ENS Lyon, I was a Research Scientist at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com) as well as a Post-Doc at [Inria, Paris](https://mimove.inria.fr/). I obtained a Ph.D. from [WINLAB](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu). I'm also co-founder and CTO of [NetMicroscope](https://netmicroscope.com).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
