I am an Associate Professor (Maître de Conférences HDR) in computer science at
[École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://ens-lyon.fr) and I am a member of
[LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/). I'm also a Junior fellow of the [Institut
universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr) (2025-2030).
<!-- , as well as the
co-founder and CTO of [NetMicroscope](https://netmicroscope.com). -->

My research focuses broadly on leveraging emergent technologies to engineer
software systems designed to measure and improve network service performance.

Before joining ENS Lyon, I was a Research Scientist at [Nokia Bell
Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com) as well as a Post-Doc at [Inria,
Paris](https://mimove.inria.fr/). I obtained a Ph.D. from
[WINLAB](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers
University](https://www.rutgers.edu).
