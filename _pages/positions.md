**Note to interested candidates:** Even when I don't have specific positions open, I am always looking for master students interested in doing a research period in my group or a Ph.D. Drop me an email if interested *specifying what line of my work interests you and why*. If you have doubts on what to include in your email, please follow [these guidelines](https://fbronzino.com/guidelines/) on how to write an introductory email.
